# HR-ADUC-Datasimulator

HR-ADUC-Datasimulator is a Python script designed to generate simulated data for Active Directory User and Group attributes. It is intended to facilitate testing and demonstration of data extraction processes, while also maintaining confidentiality by using simulated data instead of real user information.

## Features

- Generates random data to simulate extraction of attributes of Active Directory (AD) accounts.
- Helps demonstrate data extraction processes without revealing real user information.
- Allows testing and verification of data coherence between AD accounts and human resources (HR) extractions.
- Highlights anomalies and suggests modifications to improve security on the ADUC server.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Duplicate the parameters_[XX].ini file corresponding to your language and rename it as parameters.ini.
3. Customize the parameters.ini file to define specific settings for the data generation process.
4. Run the HR-ADUC-Datasimulator.py script to generate simulated data.
5. Analyze the output and use it for testing, demonstration, or security improvement purposes.
